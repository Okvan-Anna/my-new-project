# Reduce anxiety with Ai

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is made for everyone who wants help with their anxiety problems. The idea behind this project is to create a "wall" where you can write your problems and directly get help to solve them. The plan is that the "wall" will be like a therapist who you can talk to daily and get advice how to make your day better. It is important that the "wall" is up to date with the new algorithm techniques. 


## Background

This project is able to solve, or at least help with, the problem of anxiety. Everyone that need a therapist to talk with can trust the "wall" is always available (7 days at week & 24 hours a day). Maybe it is the first thing you do in the morning if you wake up with anxiety, or you turn to the "wall" during the day if you face some problems.

Challenges:
* The "wall" will not be your brain, you also need to think and learn from the "wall" and through that change your behaviour. 
* The "wall" need to be smart and see if you ask the same questions and then remind you about that so you can learn from that.


## How is it used?

The "wall" can offer a large range of support and as the time goes on, it will also learn new methods to help people with anxiety. With this, the "wall" is supposed to guide you in your behavior in order to improve your thinking and therefore minimize the level of anziety in you. This "wall" is made for everyone who struggels with anxiety and need daily guidence. The goal is also to minimize the doze of medicin that you take for your anxiety.

The "wall" will also be able to:

Listen and talk with the person;
Learn which kind of person is;
Answer specific questions (about social behavior, usefull tips, how you shall think in different situations, how you not shall think, how you control your feelings etc...).

It can be used in textual mode (like a conversation with a therapist) or in speech mode (more like a phone call with a friend). It can be used by everyone no matter where you are, but of course the "wall" is personal och no one can reach your "wall".

## Data sources and AI methods

For this project we'll need the necessary amount of data in order to program a correct algorithm of:

Speech recognition (to remember previous conversations);
Natural Lenguage Processing;
Learn from the owner;
etc... .
We need information from science and other appropriate sites that is also open source and up to date about this argument.

## Challenges

Of course as every project it has is own limitations. For instance, the "wall" needs to learn you behaviour, come up with new ideas (create a common mindset,...).

## What next?

The next step in order to maximise this bot is to create a robotic structure, in this way, we must also implement the movement and a lot of stuff that is linked to it (image recognition, recognize patterns about the user, implement responses from trusted sources,...)

It needs to be personal so you feel like the tools are tailored to you, that you get answers based on the behavior you have shown, ...
