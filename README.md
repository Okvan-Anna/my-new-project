# Reduce anxiety with Ai

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is made for everyone who wants help with their anxiety problems. The idea behind this project is to create a "wall" where you can write your problems and directly get help to solve them. The plan is that the "wall" will be like a therapist who you can talk to daily and get advice how to make your day better. It is important that the "wall" is up to date with the new algorithm techniques. 


## Background

This project is able to solve, or at least help with, the problem of anxiety. Everyone that need a therapist to talk with can trust the "wall" is always available (7 days at week & 24 hours a day). Maybe it is the first thing you do in the morning if you wake up with anxiety, or you turn to the "wall" during the day if you face some problems.

Challenges:
* The "wall" will not be your brain, you also need to think and learn from the "wall" and through that change your behaviour. 
* The "wall" need to be smart and see if you ask the same questions and then remind you about that so you can learn from that.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
